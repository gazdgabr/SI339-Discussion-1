<p>I'm Ella. Welcome to my site!</p>

<p>I currently reside in Ann Arbor as a senior in the BSI program at the University of Michigan. My focus is on <br>
  UX Design, and I am excited about the future of interaction design and its applications within multiple fields.</p>

<p>My dream is to be a chiropractor, and to directly impact individual lives
  by my work. An Information <br> background will enable me to see my field through
  a different lens and give me skills necessary to be <br> a pioneer in improving
  technology within a chiropractic context.</p>

<p>Some of my hobbies include weightlifting, snowboarding, and exploring the
  beautiful Michigan outdoors!</p>
